# action-upterm demo

This repository demonstrates using owenthereal/action-upterm to SSH into a GitHub Actions runner, backed by tmux.  
The workflow creates `demo_folder/hello.txt` so you can verify file access interactively.

## How to use
1. Push a commit or run the workflow manually.
2. Open the workflow run â†’ job logs. Look for the SSH connection string printed by the Action.
3. From your terminal: `ssh <that-connection-string>` (your GitHub profile must have an SSH public key).
4. Inside the session, try:

```
ls -la

ls -la demo_folder

cat demo_folder/hello.txt

tmux ls
```

To resume your workflow within an `upterm` session, create an empty file named `continue`:

```bash
touch continue
# or
sudo touch /continue
```

Press `C-b` followed by `d` (tmux detach command keys) to detach from the terminal without resuming the workflow. Or type exit.
